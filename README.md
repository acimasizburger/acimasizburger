## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a 2nd-year Computer Programming and Graphic Design student, with a strong passion for game development. As an aspiring indie game developer, I focus on creating engaging and memorable experiences through game design, pixel art, and storytelling.

Iâ€™ve participated in various game jams, where Iâ€™ve honed my skills in rapid prototyping, teamwork, and creative problem-solving. Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect art, designing compelling mechanics, or diving into narrative creation, Iâ€™m always excited to push my boundaries and bring new ideas to life.

Beyond game development, I have a growing interest in scriptwriting and exploring how storytelling can elevate the player experience. I believe games are a powerful medium to connect, inspire, and entertain, and Iâ€™m eager to keep learning and contributing to this vibrant industry.

Letâ€™s create something extraordinary together! ðŸš€
